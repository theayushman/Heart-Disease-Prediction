# Heart-Disease-Prediction Using AI Techniques

# Problem Definition
Heart disease is a broad term used to refer to diseases and conditions that affect the heart and circulatory system. It is also referred to as cardiovascular disease. It is a significant reason of disability worldwide. Since the heart is one of the most vital organs of the body, its diseases affect other organs and part of the body as well. The main challenge in cardiology is its discovery. There are tools available that can predict heart disease but they are either too expensive or ineffective to calculate the chance of heart disease in humans. Early detection of heart disease can reduce mortality and general complications. However, it is not possible to monitor patients every day accurately in all cases and 24-hour patient consultation by a physician is not available as it requires more wisdom, time and experience. Since we have a large amount of data in today's world, we can use this data to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease based on different criteria and different machine learning algorithms to analyze the data.

# Data Description
Heart Disease Dataset dates from 1988. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease. The dataset consists of 500 rows and 14 columns, and the data types for all features are int64/float64.

## Column Details
The names of the features in the data set are abbreviated 
and the meaning of these features is difficult to understand. 
The full medical/technical names are hard to understand for 
most of us let alone their abbreviated form. To better 
understand the meaning of the features, we have the 
responsibility to explain some of the attributes of dataset as 
follows:
• age: age in years
• sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
• cp: chest pain type ( 0 = typical angina; 1 = atypical angina; 2 = non-anginal pain; 3 = asymptomatic)
• trestbps; resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
• chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
• fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
• restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or 
depression of > 0.05 mV); 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
• thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
• exang; exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
• oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
• slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping; 1 = flat; 2 = downsloping)
• ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
• thal: (0 = error (in the original dataset 0 maps to NaN's); 1 = fixed defect; 2 = normal; 3 = reversable defect)
• target (the lable): (0 = no disease; 1 = disease)
